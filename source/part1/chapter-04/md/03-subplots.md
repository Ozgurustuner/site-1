# Creating subplots

At this point you should know the basics of making plots with Matplotlib. Now we will expand on our basic plotting skills to learn how to create more advanced plots. In this section, we will show how to visualize data using pandas/Matplotlib and create plots such as the one below.

## Preparing the data for plotting 

We can start again by reading in the data file.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fp = "data/029740.txt"

data = pd.read_csv(
    fp,
    delim_whitespace=True,
    na_values=["*", "**", "***", "****", "*****", "******"],
    usecols=["YR--MODAHRMN", "TEMP", "MAX", "MIN"],
    parse_dates=["YR--MODAHRMN"],
    index_col="YR--MODAHRMN",
)
```

After reading the file, we can rename the `TEMP` column as `TEMP_F`, since we will later convert our temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

```python
new_names = {"TEMP": "TEMP_F"}
data = data.rename(columns=new_names)
```

At this point we can quickly check the first rows of data to see whether the expected changes have occurred.

```python
data.head()
```

Next, we have to deal with no-data values. Let's start by checking how many no-data values we have.

```python
print("Number of no-data values per column: ")
print(data.isna().sum())
```

So, there are 1644 missing values in the TEMP_F column and we should remove those. We need not worry about the no-data values in `'MAX'` and `'MIN'` columns since we will not use them for the plots produced below. We can remove rows from our DataFrame where `'TEMP_F'` is missing values using the `dropna()` method.

```python
data.dropna(subset=["TEMP_F"], inplace=True)
print("Number of rows after removing no data values:", len(data))
```

#### Question 4.2

How many rows of data would remain if we removed all rows with any no-data values from our data (including no-data values in the `MAX` and `MIN` columns)? If you test this, be sure to save the modified DataFrame as another variable name or not use the `inplace` parameter.

```python
# Use this cell to enter your solution.
```

```python tags=["hide-cell"]
# Solution

len(data.dropna())
```

Now that we have loaded the data, we can convert the temperature values from Fahrenheit to Celsius, like we have in earlier chapters.

```python
data["TEMP_C"] = (data["TEMP_F"] - 32.0) / 1.8
```

We can once again now check the contents of our DataFrame.

```python
data.head()
```

## Subplots

Having processed and cleaned the data we can now continue working with it and learn how to create figures that contain {term}`subplots`. Subplots used to display multiple plots in different panels of the same figure, as shown at the start of this section (Figure 4.11).

We can start with creating the subplots by dividing the data in the data file into different groups. In this case we can divide the temperature data into temperatures for the four different seasons of the year. We can make the following selections:

- Winter (December 2012 - February 2013)
- Spring (March 2013 - May 2013)
- Summer (June 2013 - August 2013)
- Autumn (Septempber 2013 - November 2013)

```python
winter = data.loc[(data.index >= "201212010000") & (data.index < "201303010000")]
winter_temps = winter["TEMP_C"]

spring = data.loc[(data.index >= "201303010000") & (data.index < "201306010000")]
spring_temps = spring["TEMP_C"]

summer = data.loc[(data.index >= "201306010000") & (data.index < "201309010000")]
summer_temps = summer["TEMP_C"]

autumn = data.loc[(data.index >= "201309010000") & (data.index < "201312010000")]
autumn_temps = autumn["TEMP_C"]
```

Let's have a look at the data from two different seasons to see whether the preceding step worked as expected.

```python
ax1 = winter_temps.plot()
```

```python
ax2 = summer_temps.plot()
```

Based on the plots above it looks that the correct seasons have been plotted and the temperatures between winter and summer are quite different, as we would expect. One thing we might need to consider with this is that the y-axis range currently varies between the two plots and we may want to define axis ranges that ensure the data are plotted with the same y-axis ranges in all subplots. This will help make it easier to visually compare the temperatures between seasons.

**Finding the data bounds**

In order to define y-axis limits that will include the data from all of the seasons and be consistent between subplots we first need to find the minimum and maximum temperatures from all of the seasons.
In addition, we can consider that it would be beneficial to have some extra space (padding) between the y-axis limits and those values, such that the maximum y-axis limit is five degrees higher than the maximum temperature, and the minimum y-axis limit is five degrees lower than the minimum temperature. We can do that below by calculating the minumum of each seasons minumum temperature and subtracting five degrees, for example.

```python
# Find lower limit for y-axis
min_temp = min(
    winter_temps.min(), spring_temps.min(), summer_temps.min(), autumn_temps.min()
)
min_temp = min_temp - 5.0

# Find upper limit for y-axis
max_temp = max(
    winter_temps.max(), spring_temps.max(), summer_temps.max(), autumn_temps.max()
)
max_temp = max_temp + 5.0

# Print y-axis min, max
print(f"Minimum temperature: {min_temp}")
print(f"Maximum temperature: {max_temp}")
```

We can now use this temperature range to standardize the y-axis ranges of our plots.

**Displaying multiple subplots in a single figure**

With the data split into seasons and y-axis range defined we can now continue to plot data from all four seasons the same figure. We will start by creating a figure containing four subplits in a 2x2 panel using Matplotlibâ€™s `subplots()` function. In the `subplots()` function the user can specify how many rows and columns of plots they want to have in their figure.
We can also specify the size of our figure with `figsize()` parameter that takes the `width` and `height` values (in inches) as input.

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2, figsize=(12, 8))
axs
```

We can see that as a result we have now a list containing two nested lists where the first one contains the axis for column 1 and 2 on **row 1** and the second list contains the axis for columns 1 and 2 for **row 2**.

We can parse these axes into own variables so it is easier to work with them.

```python
ax11 = axs[0][0]
ax12 = axs[0][1]
ax21 = axs[1][0]
ax22 = axs[1][1]
```

Now we have four different axis variables for different panels in our figure.
Next we can use them to plot the seasonal data into them.
Let's first plot the seasons and give different colors for the lines, and specify the *y*-scale limits to be the same with all subplots.
- `c` parameter changes the color of the line.You can find an extensive list of possible colors and RGB-color codes from [this link](http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm).
- `lw` parameter controls the width of the line.
- `ylim` parameter controls the y-axis limits

```python
# Set plot line width
line_width = 1.5

# Plot data
winter_temps.plot(ax=ax11, c="blue", lw=line_width, ylim=[min_temp, max_temp])
spring_temps.plot(ax=ax12, c="orange", lw=line_width, ylim=[min_temp, max_temp])
summer_temps.plot(ax=ax21, c="green", lw=line_width, ylim=[min_temp, max_temp])
autumn_temps.plot(ax=ax22, c="brown", lw=line_width, ylim=[min_temp, max_temp])

# Display figure
fig
```

Great, now we have all the plots in same figure! However, we can see that there are some problems with our *x*-axis labels and a few missing items we can add. Let's do that below.

```python
# Create the new figure and subplots
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2, figsize=(12, 8))

# Rename the axes for ease of use
ax11 = axs[0][0]
ax12 = axs[0][1]
ax21 = axs[1][0]
ax22 = axs[1][1]
```

Now, we'll add our seasonal temperatures to the plot commands for each time period.

```python
# Set plot line width
line_width = 1.5

# Plot data
winter_temps.plot(
    ax=ax11, c="blue", lw=line_width, ylim=[min_temp, max_temp], grid=True
)
spring_temps.plot(
    ax=ax12, c="orange", lw=line_width, ylim=[min_temp, max_temp], grid=True
)
summer_temps.plot(
    ax=ax21, c="green", lw=line_width, ylim=[min_temp, max_temp], grid=True
)
autumn_temps.plot(
    ax=ax22, c="brown", lw=line_width, ylim=[min_temp, max_temp], grid=True
)

# Set figure title
fig.suptitle("2012-2013 Seasonal temperature observations - Helsinki-Vantaa airport")

# Rotate the x-axis labels so they don't overlap
plt.setp(ax11.xaxis.get_majorticklabels(), rotation=20)
plt.setp(ax12.xaxis.get_majorticklabels(), rotation=20)
plt.setp(ax21.xaxis.get_majorticklabels(), rotation=20)
plt.setp(ax22.xaxis.get_majorticklabels(), rotation=20)

# Axis labels
ax21.set_xlabel("Date")
ax22.set_xlabel("Date")
ax11.set_ylabel("Temperature [Â°C]")
ax21.set_ylabel("Temperature [Â°C]")

# Season label text
ax11.text(pd.to_datetime("20130215"), -25, "Winter")
ax12.text(pd.to_datetime("20130515"), -25, "Spring")
ax21.text(pd.to_datetime("20130815"), -25, "Summer")
ax22.text(pd.to_datetime("20131115"), -25, "Autumn")

# Display plot
fig
```

Not bad.
