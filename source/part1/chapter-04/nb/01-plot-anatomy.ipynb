    "Before starting to visualize our data on a plot our data we need to address an obvious question: **What actually is a plot?** We will not go deep into the details of different types of plots (as it is not the purpose of this book), but rather we provide a brief introduction to different plots that can be created using Python and the (essential) elements of a plot.\n",

    "There are a variety of different kinds of plots (also known as graphs, charts, diagrams, etc.) available that have been designed to visually represent the characteristics of a dataset. Here is a list of several different types of plots that can be used to present different kinds of data. You can find more information about this plots online in Wikipedia, for example.\n",
