    "My name is Dave and I give eating ice cream a score of 9 out of 10!\n",
    "My sleeping enjoyment rating is 8 / 10!\n",
    "Based on the factors above, my happiness rating is 8.5 out of 10 or 85.0 %!\n",
    "```\n",
    "For this exercise you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create three variables: one integer value (whole number) for your ice cream rating, another integer for your sleeping rating, and a character string for your first name. \n",
    "- Calculate the average of the two ratings. Store the result in a variable for your happiness.\n",
    "- Find the data type of each of the variables you have defined. Are there any surprises?\n",
    "- Reproduce your version of the example text using the `print()` function and the variables you have defined. Note that you may need to be careful combining text and numbers!"

    "- Modify the lists you just created to add the values from the table on the right, again keeping them in the same order.\n",
