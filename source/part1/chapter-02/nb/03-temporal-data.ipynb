    "> “Ever since the dawn of civilization, people have not been content to see events as unconnected and inexplicable. They have craved an understanding of the underlying order in the world.\" - Stephen Hawking (1988)\n",
    "\n",
    "Time is one of the very fundamental ways how we humans organize things in life and what we use to find understanding of the underlying world as Stephen Hawking (1988) famously put it in his book \"A brief history of time\". Hence, it is not surprising that the time dimension is very commonly attached to almost all data that we have in the world (the other dimension is naturally space or location, which we will focus in Part II). Hence, being able to handle and work with temporal information is extremely important when doing data analysis. Time information in the data allows us to see patterns through time (trends) as well as to make predictions to the future (at certain level of confidence). In this section, we will introduce some of the core ideas and functionalities how you can work with temporal data in Python and pandas."

    "## Date and time basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing any progamming, we need to understand a few details about time conventions themselves. There are a couple of ways how the time information (commonly referred as `timestamp`) is typically represented. The first one is to represent the temporal information as text with specific format such as `\"2020-12-24T09:12:45Z\"` which follows an international ISO 8601 standard [^isostandard]. In this format, the date components (year, month, day) are separated with dash (`-`) and the time components (hour, minute, second) are separated with colon (`:`). Typically there is a letter `T` separating the date and time components from each other (in some other formats, there could just be a space between them). The letter `Z` at the end of the string relates to time zones and means that the time here is represented as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Time zone information around the world are expressed using negative or positive offsets from the UTC. `UTC±00:00` is the same as Greenwhich Mean Time (GMT), and it was chosen after a series of conferences between 1881-1884 (Ogle, 2015) as the worldwide standard for representing the zone 0 to which all other time zones in the world are relative to. For instance, the local time in Finland is two hours ahead of UTC, meaning that the time zone information is expressed as `UTC+2` or `UTC+02:00`, whereas the local time in New York is four hours behind UTC respectively (i.e. `UTC-4`). Another commonly used way to represent time is to use a so called *Unix time* (also known as *Epoch time* or *POSIX time*). Unix time is expressed as number of seconds since *Unix Epoch* that was on the first of January 1970 at midnight in UTC (i.e. `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`). This system was developed to describe a point in time in numerical format, and it is widely used in computers by different operating systems. Unix time increments every second and e.g. the Unix time of December 22nd 2020 at 15:00:00 (UTC) is represented as a single number `1608649200`. Using this kind of numerical representation of time makes it much easier for computers to store and manipulate the time information compared to having the information in textual format (`2020-12-22T15:00:00Z`).

    "## Working with temporal data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will learn how temporal data can be handled in Python in general. The most fundamental Python library for dealing with temporal data is called `datetime` that supplies functionalities to construct and manipulate dates and times. The module is one of the Python's standard libraries, hence you do not need to install it separately. Other useful libraries for dealing with time and dates are `time` and `calendar` which provide some additional functionalities in addition to the functionalities provided by `datetime`. In addition, `pytz` library provides many useful functionalities to deal with time zone information and `dateutil` provides some handy functionalities to automate date parsing. Most often the `datetime` module and `pytz` (in addition to pandas) provide everything you need when doing analysis with temporal data. "

    "## Constructing datetime objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A `datetime` object is a representation of time in a way that Python can understand and operate with it. With the `datetime` library it is possible to construct a `datetime` object for example by `parsing` it from text following the ISO 8601 format or from the Unix timestamp (notice that the name of the library and the object are the same). Let's see how we can construct a `datetime` object from text using a function `strptime()`. The `strptime()` function takes the variable `timestamp` as the first argument representing the time in textual format and a second argument (\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S\") which looks quite complicated, but it is the `format code` that instructs the `datetime` how the textual representation of the time should be interpreted:"

    "As a result we get a `datetime` object in which the date has been converted into a set of numbers, in which the first one is the year, second one is month, third one day, and so on. This structure is always the same, no matter in what format the input data has been. By using the format codes (i.e. the second argument of the function), we can tell the computer that the first component in our string represents year in 4 digits. The `%Y` characters (i.e. a *directive*) is a special way to instruct the computer to do so. In a similar manner, we can instruct the computer to read the month based on numbers with two digits (`12`) using the directive `%m`. As you can see, there is always a `%` character and then some letter after it, which is the way how we determine how the date is formatted in our text. Notice that the date components are separated with dash (`-`) and the time components are separated with colons (`:`). As we can see from our format code, we can add those separator characters between the directives just as they are represented in the timestamp. Following this approach it is possible to parse basically any kind of time information represented as text.

This functionality can be very useful when working with temporal data from different parts of the world. Quite often the data collected from different global services (such as tweets collected from Twitter) store the information as UTC0 values. Hence, it is up to the user to parse the correct local time for tweets posted in different parts of the world. Using pandas for doing these kind of manipulation with the temporal data is extremely handy and efficient.    "
