    "# Installation and setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how to install Python and many of its wonderful libraries is one of the first things that you want to learn. Luckily, installing Python and its libraries is very easy once you are familiar with some basic concepts and approaches to manage your Python installations. In the next paragraphs, we provide some terminology, background information and good practices on how to handle Python installations before showing in detail how to install all the libraries used in this book. Next paragraphs probably include many new terms and some technical details that you might not understand at this point, but don't worry, getting started is easy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling dependencies:** Because Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, there is also a huge number of libraries available for it. Having a large ecosystem of libraries is naturally a great thing, but it also bring some challenges that needs to be considered when doing installations. Many of the libraries developed for Python take advantage of, and are strongly linked to, other Python libraries. This is very useful because developers don't need to create everything from scratch when developing libraries, allowing faster and (typically) more stable progress of the libraries. Python's libraries are also evolving and improving all the time, and developers typically publish new versions of the libraries regularly. Because of these regular updates and *`{term} dependencies <Dependency>`* between Python packages, it is important to ensure that different packages (and their different versions) work well together. Luckily, Python has good tools (package managers) to help handling these installations, which solve all the dependencies between libraries for you, and allow you to keep your libraries up-to-date easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Python installation with Miniconda:** Even though it is possible to install Python from the Python homepage [^Python website], we highly recommend using Miniconda [^miniconda] to install Python. Miniconda is a Python distribution that comes with Python interpreter and a small number of essential packages, such as package manager called `conda`, which makes it easy to install Python packages. Miniconda is professionally maintained and widely used installation package for getting started with Python. It is free to use for individual hobbyists, students, universities, non-profit organizations, or businesses with less than 200 employees (as of May, 2022). For larger businesses, we recommend to install Python using Miniforge [^miniforge], which is identical to Miniconda, but does not have any commercial restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Package managers:** Package managers, such as conda (or `mamba` which is a faster version of conda) are extremely useful tools to install Python packages. In essence, a package manager is a tool that makes life much easier when installing new packages for Python. Package managers are easy to use from terminal/command prompt, and some IDEs also provide nice graphical user interfaces for handling the installations. In addition to conda/mamba, it is good to know that there are also other package managers for Python (such as pip, Pipenv and poetry). Generally, we encourage you to use conda/mamba when installing packages, because they work reliably with all operating systems (including Windows), and they can also handle packages that contain code written in other languages. Many scientific and GIS libraries for Python include parts which are written in C, due to significant boost in performance (speed). You can also combine installations with conda/mamba and pip which might be sometimes necessary if a package is not available via conda, but can be installed with pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Virtual environments:** Although *{term}`virtual environments <virtual environment>`* are not necessarily needed when first starting to learn programming, it is a good practice to create an isolated environment for your programming project (e.g. related to a specific course, manuscript/thesis, data analysis pipeline or software project). A virtual environment is a Python programming environment which works in a way that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from the ones installed in other virtual environments (or used by the operating system). This ensures that all the installed packages work nicely together. You can create multiple environments on your computer for different projects (having e.g. different versions of Python and specific libraries), and you can swap easily between environments by *activating* them from the command prompt with a single command (see next section for details). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuring and documenting your environments:** Installing Python packages can be done easily one by one from a command prompt. However, to document and keep track of your packages while ensuring that your installation works smoothly, we recommended to write a dedicated configuration file which lists all the packages in your environment (see Figure 1.12). Python package managers support various formats to list/write your dependencies, but conda/mamba uses a configuration file written to `environment.yaml`. YAML is a human-friendly configuration language which is easy to use and a popular approach to manage Python environments. The name of the file can be anything, but file format should be `.yaml`. In the configuration file, you can control all the specifications of your virtual environment, including the name for your environment and the version of Python that should be used in the environment. In addition, you can specify if you want to use a specific version of a given package (e.g. a slightly older version), or go with the newest version available (which is the default). It is a good practice to install all packages (if possible) from the same conda channel (e.g. `conda-forge` which we recommend), and not to mix conda and pip for installations if not strictly necessary. A conda channel is a remote location/directory having a dedicated web address where packages are stored. The channels serve as the base for hosting packages, and the package managers (such as conda/mamba) search and download the packages from these channels.\n",

    "\n",
    "To get started programming with Python  In order to be able to follow and reproduce the examples in the rest of the book, here we present some information about how to install Python on your own computer along with all of the recommended software libraries we use. This is not strictly necessary, as it is possible to use the Binder cloud computing platform from the book website [https://pythongis.org/](https://pythongis.org/) to interact with the book materials. However, if you would like to get the most out of the book and ensure you're easily able to continue with Python afterward, we strongly recommend you install Python and Jupyter on your own computer.\n",

    "In the sections that follow, we provide instructions for the installation of the Python using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) [^miniconda]. for the Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. Miniconda is a lightweight installer for Python packages that includes a minimal Python environment. You should first install Miniconda and then you can use the [Python environment file we provide]() to set up a Python environment with all of the software libraries used in this book. We provide instructions for both steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book assumes you are using **Python 3**, so for all operating systems we recommend you install Miniconda based on Python 3. At the time of writing of this book, Python 3.8 is the Python version that is recommended (e.g., Figure 1.12), however future versions of Python 3.X should also be suitable. Importantly, the coding examples we present will not work with Python 2.X, so be careful to install the correct version of Miniconda!\n",
