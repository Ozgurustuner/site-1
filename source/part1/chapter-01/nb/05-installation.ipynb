    "Knowing how to install Python and many of its wonderful libraries is one of the first things that you want to learn. Luckily, installing Python and its libraries is very easy once you are familiar with some basic concepts and approaches to manage your Python installations. Here, we provide some background, terminology and good practices about handling Python installations. If you want to get going directly, you can jump to the next section, where we show how to install Python and all the libraries used in this book.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, there is also a huge number of libraries available for it. Having a large ecosystem of libraries is naturally a great thing, but it also bring some challenges that needs to be considered when doing installations. Many of the libraries developed for Python take advantage of, and are strongly linked to, other Python libraries, which is very useful because developers don't need to create everything from scratch when developing their own libraries. Because of this, there are *`{term} dependencies <Dependency>`* between Python packages, and it is important to be able to handle the dependencies and ensure that different packages (and different versions of them) work well together (i.e. we are *solving dependencies*). Python's libraries are also evolving and improving all the time, and developers are publishing new versions of the libraries regularly. Luckily, Python has good tools to help handling these installations and keep your libraries up to date. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though it is possible to install Python from the Python homepage [^Python website], we highly recommend using Miniconda to install Python. Miniconda comes with Python and a small number of essential packages. Additional packages can be installed using the package management systems `mamba` or `conda`. Both offer similar functionality (mamba is a, but we suggest using mamba, because it is significantly faster for installing the libraries needed for using Python for GIS. The biggest benefit of mamba/conda\n",

    "- When installing Python and specific libraries for it, we recommend to create a *{term}`virtual environment <Virtual environment>`* for your packages. \n",

    "- When updating a library, if you face issues, it's often better to re-create the whole environment from scracth. \n",

    "\n",
    "To get started programming with Python  In order to be able to follow and reproduce the examples in the rest of the book, here we present some information about how to install Python on your own computer along with all of the recommended software libraries we use. This is not strictly necessary, as it is possible to use the Binder cloud computing platform from the book website [https://pythongis.org/](https://pythongis.org/) to interact with the book materials. However, if you would like to get the most out of the book and ensure you're easily able to continue with Python afterward, we strongly recommend you install Python and Jupyter on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sections that follow, we provide instructions for the installation of the Python using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) [^miniconda]. for the Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. Miniconda is a lightweight installer for Python packages that includes a minimal Python environment. You should first install Miniconda and then you can use the [Python environment file we provide]() to set up a Python environment with all of the software libraries used in this book. We provide instructions for both steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book assumes you are using **Python 3**, so for all operating systems we recommend you install Miniconda based on Python 3. At the time of writing of this book, Python 3.8 is the Python version that is recommended (e.g., Figure 1.12), however future versions of Python 3.X should also be suitable. Importantly, the coding examples we present will not work with Python 2.X, so be careful to install the correct version of Miniconda!"
