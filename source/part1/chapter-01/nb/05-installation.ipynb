    "\n",
    "In order to be able to follow and reproduce the examples in the rest of the book, here we present some information about how to install Python on your own computer along with all of the recommended software libraries we use. This is not strictly necessary, as it is possible to use the Binder cloud computing platform from [the book website](https://pythongis.org/) to interact with the book materials. However, if you would like to get the most out of the book and ensure you're easily able to continue with Python afterward, we strongly recommend you install Python and Jupyter on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sections that follow, we provide instructions for the installation of the Python using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for the Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. Miniconda is a lightweight installer for Python packages that includes a minimal Python environment. You should first install Miniconda and then you can use the a [Python environment file we provide]() to set up a Python environment with all of the software libraries used in this book. We provide instructions for both steps below."

    "## Which Python version to install?\n",
    "\n",
    "This book assumes you are using **Python 3**, so for all operating systems we recommend you install Miniconda based on Python 3. At the time of writing of this book, Python 3.8 is the Python version that is recommended (e.g., Figure 1.12), however future versions of Python 3.X should also be suitable. Importantly, the coding examples we present will not work with Python 2.X, so be careful to install the correct version of Miniconda!"
