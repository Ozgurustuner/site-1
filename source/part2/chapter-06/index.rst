Vector data processing
=======================

Here we introduce basics of vector data processing.

**This chapter is under construction.**

Sub-sections:

- Intro Geographic objects in Python

- Introduction to spatial data analysis with geopandas

- Reading and writing vector data (Data I/O)

- Coordinate reference systems

- Analyzing spatial relationships

  - Spatial queries and selections
  - Neighborhood analysis - Spatial weights (linkage to Rey et al. 2020)
  - Improving performance - Spatial index

- Geometric data conversions â€“ from form to another

  - Dissolving and merging geometries
  - Geocoding (addresses <-> points)
  - Interpolation (e.g. IDW)
  - Tesselation
  - Overlay analysis
