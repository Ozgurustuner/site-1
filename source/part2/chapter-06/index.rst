Chapter 6: Vector data processing
=================================

Here we introduce basics of vector data processing.

**This chapter is under construction.**

Sub-sections:
- Intro Geographic objects in Python
- Introduction to spatial data analysis with geopandas
- Reading and writing vector data (Data I/O)
- Coordinate reference systems
- Analyzing spatial relationships
    - Spatial queries and selections
    - Neighborhood analysis - Spatial weights (linkage to Rey et al. 2020)
    - Improving performance - Spatial index
- Geometric data conversions â€“ from form to another
    - Dissolving and merging geometries
    - Geocoding (addresses <-> points)
    - Interpolation (e.g. IDW)
    - Tesselation
    - Overlay analysis
